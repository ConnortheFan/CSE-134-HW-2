                <p>Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm Connor Fan, and as of making this website, a 3rd year Computer Science undergraduate student at UC San Diego.</p>

                <p>I'm currently looking for a paid internship, so if anyone visiting is interested, feel free to contact me  <a href="/contactme.html">here</a></p>

                    <p>Here's where I will frontpage all my cool projects that I've done. I don't really have much for it now, but hopefully, it will be completely filled out when I'm done with it and have more experience.</p>

                <h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>

                <h3>Teaching you how to algorithmically solve <strong>any</strong> sudoku</h3>

                <p>Have you ever been stuck on a <strong>really hard</strong> Sudoku? Well I have and it <em>sucks</em>, a lot. <br> Even though I am a bit of a Sudoku addict (especially with variants), I still sometimes struggle to see just the one move that will let colapse the puzzle. To fix this, and also to teach my friends how to do Sudoku as well, I made Sudoku Solver!</p>

                <p>To learn more, see my <a href="projects/sudokusolver.html">Sudoku Solver page</a>.</p>
